# @gnoesiboe/branch-tool

**Beware!** This package is still in beta, and is still in heavy development!

This package contains CLI tools for easy branching:

-   Better scannable listing of branches
-   Easy means to create new branches in the format `{type}/{TrackerKey}_{description}`
-   Easier deleting of (merged) branches
